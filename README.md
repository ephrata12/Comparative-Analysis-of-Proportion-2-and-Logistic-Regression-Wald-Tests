# Comparative Analysis of Proportion Chi-squared and Logistic Regression Wald Tests

## Overview
This project examines the performance of the proportion Chi-squared test and the logistic regression Wald test in comparing two proportions. The analysis explores theoretical derivations, numerical simulations, and practical examples to determine the superior test under different scenarios, with a focus on power and sensitivity.
